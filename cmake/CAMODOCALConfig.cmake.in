# Config file for the CAMODOCAL package
# This adds CAMODOCAL IMPORTED target
#
# Usage example:
# 
#   find_package(CAMODOCAL)
#   add_executable(foo foo.cpp)
#   target_link_libraries(foo CAMODOCAL)
#
# Additionaly you can use the following variables:
#
#  CAMODOCAL_FOUND   	    - standard CMake Package found indicator
#  CAMODOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR  - include directories for CAMODOCAL alone
#  CAMODOCAL_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories for CAMODOCAL with all dpendencies
#  CAMODOCAL_DEFINITIONS  - Definitions needed to build with CAMODOCAL
#  CAMODOCAL_LIBRARIES    - Libraries needed to build with CAMODOCAL

# todo: implement a mechanism for find_dependency scripts to work
# include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)
# find_dependency(Gflags)
# find_dependency(Glog)
# find_dependency(Gtest)
# find_dependency(LAPACK)
# find_dependency(OpenCV)
# find_dependency(SuiteSparse)

# Our library dependencies (contains definitions for IMPORTED targets)
